This is a simple reproducible example for an Upwork posting.

I have created a sample 404 page that demonstrates the issue I am seeing. Navigate to /404 and you will see the sample page. Or, open screenshot.PNG.

The problem is that the background image does not extend all the way to the bottom of the page. Instead, it only extends partway down, and there is a very large grey bar at the bottom of the page. I need this image to cover the entire page.

I am seeing this on several other pages as well in my real version of the app, so please also tell me where I went wrong, so that I can fix the issue on those other pages as well.


Solution
I came across this on upwork. I have it fixed but unfortunately I dont have enough connect to send proposal but at the same time I need to land my first gig.
This is the solution now
